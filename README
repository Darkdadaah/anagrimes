This tool is called "Anagrimes" (from French anagrammes + rimes) and is used to extract data from Wiktionary dumps.

This was developped mainly for the French Wiktionary version (Wiktionnaire).

Some basic Anagrimes tools:
* dico-diffs.pl = diff between 2 Wiktionary in different languages
* dico-genie.pl = create an XML file from a Wiktionary dump (INCOMPLETE)
* dico-liste.pl = create a list of wiki articles from a Wiktionary dump that match certain conditions
* dico-phile.pl = create a list of words from an Wikimedia dump that can't be found in a given list
* dico-table.pl = create tables for all articles, words and languages from a Wiktionary dump
